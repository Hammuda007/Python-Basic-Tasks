 = mean the variabel has this value , e.g x= 5

 == mean question if this variabel has this value
'''
 # 2 : what do we mean by using =!

# 4 : Create a variabel x with value of 10

x = 10

# 5 : Increse x value by 15 using assignment operatores
x += 5

# 6 : Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operatores

x /= 5

# 7 : Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operatores

x *= 10

# 8 : Get Module of x on 3 using //////////

30%3

# 9 : Using python print module 11 to 4

print(11%4)

# 10 : print the exponent of 2,3
x = 2
x **=3
print (x)

# 11 : Divide 11 by 3 using python division

x=11
x/=3
print(x)

# 12 : Can we divid 11 by 3 and get an int number
'''
yes with //=
